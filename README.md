Optimization Project

There are two files in this repository:
1. aca.py - implements the ant colony optimization for TSP.
2. ga.py - implements the genetic algorithm for TSP.

How to run our code:<br />
first, you need to choose a dataset from the 3 given datasets: Oliver30, Berlin52, Eil51<br />
you do that by entering the dataset name in the "dataset" variable.<br />
Then you can run the code by writing in the terminal: python3 aca.py<br />
(maybe you will need to install some imports in order to run our code)<br />
The output will contain 3 prints:
1. The shortest path and its distance.
2. The run time.
3. The memory usage.
